**Sample FORTRAN Code**

A FORTRAN example file, called Example.For, is available to help software developers link new code with the routines used in REFPROP. The file is located in the EXAMPLES directory where the REFPROP program was installed. Sample :ref:`Visual Basic <sample_visual_basic_code>`  and :ref:`Excel <excel_spreadsheets>`  files are also included with REFPROP.

The program is only intended to show how the calling routines work. Comments are given throughout the code describing the various calls and procedures. Additional details on the subroutines and functions are given in the main FORTRAN code included with REFPROP. The FORTRAN code is stored in the 'fortran' subdirectory of the REFPROP installation. (By default, this would be C:\Program Files\REFPROP\fortran.)

The file manual.txt located in the FORTRAN directory gives additional details about compiling the code as well as the batch file used to create the REFPROP.DLL file.
