**DLLs**

Several examples are included that show how to access the routines within the REFPROP.DLL file. These examples are explained in the following sections:

:ref:`Excel spreadsheet <excel_spreadsheets>` 
:ref:`Visual Basic sample program <sample_visual_basic_code>` 
:ref:`C++ sample program <sample_c_code>` 
:ref:`Connecting with MatLab <sample_matlab_code>` 
:ref:`Connecting with LabVIEW <samplelabviewcode>` 

In addition, users can link directly to the Fortran source code, thus avoiding the use of the dll.

:ref:`Fortran sample program <sample_fortran_code>`
