**Connecting With MATLAB**

A sample MATLAB file, called refpropm.m, is available to help software developers link MATLAB with the routines used in REFPROP. Sample :ref:`Visual Basic <sample_visual_basic_code>`  code and :ref:`Excel <excel_spreadsheets>`  spreadsheets are also included. Instructions and the latest versions of the MATLAB routines are available on the :ref:`REFPROP FAQ <faq>`  `website <http://www.boulder.nist.gov/div838/theory/refprop/Frequently_asked_questions.htm#MatLabApplications>`_.
