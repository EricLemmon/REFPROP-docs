The following information describes a procedure for quickly getting the REFPROP program set up and running. We encourage you to explore the many menu options and the Help file so you can obtain the most from the program.

Upon starting the program, a "Credits" dialog box appears; click 'Continue'. Other information or warning boxes may appear, as appropriate. Once these have been dispatched, a blank screen appears within the program boundaries with a row of commands at the top. You should first select the fluid you wish to use by clicking on the :ref:`Substance <substance>`  command and then on one of the options labeled :ref:`Pure Fluid <purefluid>` , :ref:`Predefined Mixture <predefinedmixture>` , or :ref:`Define New Mixture <definenewmixture>` . If you select Pure Fluid, a dialog appears that lists compounds available in REFPROP. The number of fluids displayed can be substantial, making it more tedious to find what you are looking for. To decrease the number of fluids shown, select one of the predefined sets in the Substance/Specify Fluid Set menu, or set up your own combination using the 'Add New Set' option in that same menu. To permanently save your selection, select ':ref:`Save Current Options <savecurrentoptions>` ' from the :ref:`Options <options>`  menu and save the options as defaults.prf.

At this point you may calculate properties (using default settings) or customize the units system and properties displayed. To calculate, click on the Calculate command and then on the Specified State Points option. A blank grid appears on which you can enter properties. Once two inputs have been entered, the other properties in the active row will be calculated if it is a valid state point. The Saturation Points option is similar to the Specified State Points option except that only one input is needed and the properties will always be at saturation. Calculating tables is accomplished by clicking on either the Saturation Tables or Isoproperty Tables options.

To select which properties you would like displayed, click on the Options command, then on Properties. Under the 'Thermodynamic' tab, you can select properties like temperature, pressure, and enthalpy. Under the 'Transport, Misc.' tab, you can select properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension.

If you would like to change the units you will use for the calculations, select the Options command, and then click on Units. The Units screen allows you to change each type individually, or use a set of predefined units. If you are using English units, you would click on the English button under the 'Reset Units' label. This dialog also allows you to select whether you will use mass or molar properties, and whether you will use a mass or molar basis to enter the compositions for mixtures.

If you desire to make plots, many predefined plots have been set up for you. For example, click on Plot then on P-h Diagram. You can then make changes to the dialog that appears and click OK. A plot will be generated based on your inputs.

All of these commands and those not described here are available in this Help file. The :ref:`Index <contents>`  will help you find other information.
