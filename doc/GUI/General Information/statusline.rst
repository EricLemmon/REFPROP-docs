Status Line
***********

The Status Line is displayed at the bottom of the screen. It displays the fluid name and reference state. For mixtures it also displays the components and composition. If the fluid (or mixture) applicable to the active window is different than the current fluid (or mixture), information on both is shown in the status line. The reference state for enthalpy and entropy values (selected with the :ref:`reference`  command) is shown last. Clicking the mouse button on the Status Line brings up the :ref:`fluidinformation`  window.
