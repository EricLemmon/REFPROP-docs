Help Index
**********

The Help Index command on the :ref:`Help menu <helpmenu>`  opens the Help file and displays the :ref:`Welcome to REFPROP <welcometorefprop>`  page at the top of the help file. At the bottom of this page is a list of the contents of the help file, which is always also available as a tab at the left of the help file (unless you have elected not to display it by clicking the 'Hide' button in the upper left of the help file. In that case, click 'Show' in this same location to redisplay it.) The Help program can also be opened by pressing the F1 key, which will display help relating to the contents of the current window.

The Help file is a hypertext document. Clicking on a highlighted word displays information on that subject. You can also click the Index tab in the Help program to search for a particular keyword (as well as listing all of the available keywords.)
