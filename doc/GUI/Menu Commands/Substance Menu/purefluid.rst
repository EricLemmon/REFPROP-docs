**Pure Fluid**

The Pure Fluid dialog lists the pure fluids available. By default, only the more commonly used fluids are displayed; use the :ref:`Specify Fluid Set <specifyfluidset>`  command to modify the displayed list of fluids. Select the fluid you want to use by clicking on the fluid name. Click the Info button to display the :ref:`Pure Fluid Information <fluidinformation>`  dialog, which provides critical constants and other property information for the selected fluid.

If a :ref:`fluid set <specifyfluidset>`  has been specified, then the 'All fluids' button will display all of the fluids available, not just those in the specified set. The pure fluids can be sorted by short name (or nickname), full name, CAS number, full chemical formula, short chemical formula, synonym, or UN number. This is useful for fluids such as acetone, which is often called propanone, where the name known to the user may not be listed in one of the categories.
