Predefined Mixture
******************

The Predefined Mixture dialog will display a list of the currently defined mixtures available. A number of predefined mixtures are provided with the program. These include the refrigerant blends defined in ASHRAE Standard 34, air, and several standard natural gas blends.

You can specify new mixtures consisting of up to twenty pure components using the :ref:`definenewmixture` command. Clicking the Info button will bring up the :ref:`fluidinformation`  window in which the critical point information, components, and composition of the mixture can be viewed.
