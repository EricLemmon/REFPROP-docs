Pseudo Pure Fluid
*****************

The Pseudo Pure Fluid dialog lists all of the mixtures that are available as pseudo pure fluids. Select the fluid you want to use by clicking on the fluid name. The properties that are calculated for pseudo pure fluids are based on equations of state that have been developed solely for a specific composition. Click the Info button to display the :ref:`fluidinformation`  dialog, which provides critical constants and other property information for the selected fluid.

These calculations are generally based on mixture models that were fit to a wide variety of properties at various compositions. The uncertainties of the pseudo pure fluid equations are often higher than the corresponding mixture model. However, the calculational speed will be much faster, especially for saturation properties.
