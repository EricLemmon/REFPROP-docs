Specify Fluid Set
*****************

With the increase in the number of fluids contained in REFPROP, it is often desirable to display only selected fluids of interest to the user. This is done through the Specify Fluid Set dialog. Six default sets are available, and can be changed by the user to match their own preferences. To use one of the six sets, simply click on it and press OK.

To enter a new set, press the Add New Set button and enter a descriptive name. The Rename button allows you to rename a file set, and the Delete Set button allows you to delete the set. To specify which fluids are in the set, press the Edit Set button and enter/delete fluids in a similar manner as is done in the :ref:`definenewmixture` dialog.

The set labeled 'calibration fluids' contains those fluids that generally have both high accuracy equations of state and transport equations. The user should consult the :ref:`fluidinformation`  screen to determine what the actual uncertainties in the equations are.

The sets are saved to the hard drive once you press OK. There is no need to save the options to keep the changes just made.
