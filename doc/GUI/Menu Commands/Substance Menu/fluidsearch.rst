**Fluid Search**

The Fluid Search dialog can be used to find fluids that fit within a range of values. Either all of the fluids in the database can be searched, or only those in the :ref:`specified fluid set <specifyfluidset>`. To search for fluids within a specified property range, click on the check box for that property and enter the ranges desired in the unit system displayed. Multiple properties can be checked simultaneously. The properties that can be searched include the critical temperature, pressure, and density, the normal boiling point, the molar mass (molecular weight), the triple point temperature, and the liquid density at the normal boiling point.
