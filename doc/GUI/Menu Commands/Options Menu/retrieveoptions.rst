Retrieve Options
****************

The Retrieve Options command brings up a dialog from which a preference file (identified with a .Prf filename extension), previously stored with the :ref:`savecurrentoptions` command, can be selected. The :ref:`units`, :ref:`reference`, :ref:`properties`, :ref:`preferences`, and :ref:`purefluid` are changed to the specifications in the selected options file.

The Defaults.Prf file is automatically loaded at program startup. After you have set up the reference state, properties, preferences, and fluid that you would like to use on a general basis, save these options by choosing the :ref:`savecurrentoptions` command and enter Defaults.Prf as the file name.
