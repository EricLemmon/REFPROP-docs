Property Order
**************

The property order dialog defines the order of the properties that will appear when a table is generated. Select the property that you wish to move, and use the 'Move up', 'Move down', 'Move to top', and 'Move to bottom' buttons to change the property order. The property order can also be changed by selecting a property with the up and down arrow keys, and then moving the property using the up and down arrow keys while holding down the shift key.

The property order is saved with other :ref:`preferences`  when the :ref:`savecurrentoptions`  command is issued. It is restored to a previously saved option with the :ref:`retrieveoptions`  command, or :ref:`opensession` command.
