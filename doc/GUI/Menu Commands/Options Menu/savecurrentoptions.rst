Save Current Options
********************

The Save Current Options command brings up a dialog from which a file name can be chosen, identified by a .Prf filename extension. The file stores the choices made in the :ref:`units`, :ref:`reference`, :ref:`preferences`, :ref:`properties`, and :ref:`propertyorder`  dialogs. In addition, the current fluid, selected with the :ref:`purefluid`, :ref:`predefinedmixture`, or :ref:`definenewmixture` commands, and other various settings are stored.

The program reads the Defaults.Prf file at startup. If you want to change the preferences that appear when the program is started, save your preferences in the Defaults.Prf file. You can restore options with the :ref:`retrieveoptions`  command.
