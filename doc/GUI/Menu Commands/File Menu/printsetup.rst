Print Setup and Dialog
**********************

The Print Setup command allows the selection of the printer and printer options, such as landscape or portrait formats. The selected printer and options are applied to the output when the :ref:`savetables`  command is issued.

The Print Dialog command allows for a few additional options while printing, most important is the 'Print to file' option. This option sends the output to a file that can then be used in such applications as making PDFs. Unlike the Print Setup command, the Print Dialog command first displays the menu for selecting tables or plots to print, then activates the dialog menu before printing.
