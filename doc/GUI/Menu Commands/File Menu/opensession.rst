**Open**

The Open command reads a file previously saved with the :ref:`Save <filesave>`  command. The files are identified by a .RFP filename extension. The Open command restores the program to the state it was in when the :ref:`Save <filesave>`  command was issued. Thus, the :ref:`unit system <units>`, :ref:`reference state <reference>`, :ref:`properties <properties>`, :ref:`fluid <substance>`, and all :ref:`tables <isopropertytables>`  and :ref:`plots <plotwindow>`  are restored. Note that the Open command will replace all settings and windows of the current session with those from the previously saved file; REFPROP will prompt the user to :ref:`Save <filesave>`  the current session before opening the saved session.
