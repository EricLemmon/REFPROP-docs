**Save Tables and Print Tables**

The Save Tables command displays a dialog that allows the data in one or more of the current tables to be saved to a file in ASCII format. The selected delimiter is placed between each value in a row. Most spreadsheet programs understand the tab character as a separator for items in the same row. The return character is used to signify the end of the row. When the data in this format are read from the file into a spreadsheet application, each value goes into a separate cell. If 'Spaces' is selected as the delimiter, the width of the columns can be specified.

The Print command allows one or more of the tables and/or plots to be printed. Use the :ref:`Print Setup <printsetup>`  command before selecting the Print command if the default printer or printer options (paper size, orientation, etc.) need to be changed.

When printing or saving tables, the previously generated tables (and plots when printing) are shown in a list at the left. Click on the names of the tables or plots you want to print and then click the '&gt;' button (or press the period or '&gt;' key) to move them from the left list to the right list. If you click the '&gt;&gt;' button, all of the tables and plots in the left list will be moved. To remove tables or plots from the selected list, select the names and then click the '&lt;' button (or press the comma or '&lt;' key). The tables and plots in the selected list are saved or printed in the order in which they appear in the list.

To save or print the column headings (the property type and units), select the 'Include Column Heading' option.

When saving tables, the 'Full width' option prints each line of the table on a single line of the file. The 'Page width' option formats the tables so that all the properties fit within 80 columns in the file. The lines are broken up and printed in different sections, similar to that done during printing.
