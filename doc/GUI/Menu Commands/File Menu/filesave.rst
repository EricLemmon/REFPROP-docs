Save
****

The Save command saves the current state of the program to a file with a .RFP filename extension. This file can later be recalled with the :ref:`opensession`  command. All current information is saved, including the :ref:`units`, :ref:`reference`, :ref:`properties`, :ref:`propertyorder`  and :ref:`substance` as well as all :ref:`isopropertytables`  and :ref:`plotwindow`. You will be asked if you want to save when you exit the program if the 'Prompt to save session when closing' option is selected in the :ref:`preferences`.
