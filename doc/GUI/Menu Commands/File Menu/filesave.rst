**Save**

The Save command saves the current state of the program to a file with a .RFP filename extension. This file can later be recalled with the :ref:`Open <opensession>`  command. All current information is saved, including the :ref:`unit system <units>` , :ref:`reference state <reference>` , :ref:`properties <properties>` , :ref:`property order <propertyorder>`  and :ref:`fluid <substance>`  as well as all :ref:`tables <isopropertytables>`  and :ref:`plots <plotwindow>`. You will be asked if you want to save when you exit the program if the 'Prompt to save session when closing' option is selected in the :ref:`preferences <preferences>`.
