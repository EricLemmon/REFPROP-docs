**Rename Window**

Each table and plot window is provided with a default title when it is generated. You can change the default window title by entering an alternative in the edit space provided. This title is used in the :ref:`Save Tables <savetables>`, :ref:`Print, <savetables>`  :ref:`New Plot <newplot>`, and :ref:`Overlay Plot <overlayplot>`  dialogs for identification.
