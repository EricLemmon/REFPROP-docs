Each table and plot window is provided with a default title when it is generated. You can change the default window title by entering an alternative in the edit space provided. This title is used in the :ref:`savetables`, :ref:`printsetup`, :ref:`newplot`, and :ref:`overlayplot` dialogs for identification.
