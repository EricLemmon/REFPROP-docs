The Paste command is used to enter values contained in the clipboard into open tables in the program. This command is typically used in conjunction with a Copy command from a spreadsheet application. Paste can be used only in the :ref:`specifiedstatepoints` or :ref:`saturationtables` tables. Values in the same row must be separated by tabs. A return character must be used to separate data in successive rows.
