Copy Plot
*********

The Copy Plot command copies a selected plot to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into other applications. The quality of the plot depends on the screen resolution; the copy is simply a bit-mapped image of that displayed on the screen. For higher quality outputs, see the :ref:`printsetup`  command.
