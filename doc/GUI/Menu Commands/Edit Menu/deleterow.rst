Inserting and Deleting Rows
***************************

The Insert Row command inserts a blank row into the current table where the cursor is located. The Delete Row command allows a specified row to be permanently removed from the table. In both cases, the rows are not renumbered. These commands are accessible only if a window displaying a table is active.
