Copy All or Selected Table Data
*******************************

The Copy All Table Data command copies all of the information in a table to the clipboard. The descriptive column headings will be included with the numerical data if this option has been selected in the :ref:`preferences`.

The Copy Selected Table Data command copies the selected section of a table to the clipboard. If none of the cells have been selected, only the value in the current cell will be copied to the clipboard. To copy part of the data in a table, select the cells to be copied by clicking in the upper left cell followed by a click in the lower right cell with the Shift key held down (or simply click and drag the mouse). Selected cells are displayed in inverted color. Alternatively, use the :ref:`selectall`  command to select all of the cells in the table. Once the desired cells are selected, use the :ref:`copytabledata` command to copy them to the clipboard.

Tab characters are used as separators between the values copied to the clipboard. A return character is placed at the end of each row. With this format, the selected data can be pasted into most spreadsheet programs and word processors.
