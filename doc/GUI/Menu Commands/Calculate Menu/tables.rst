Tables
******

Tables can be generated from a variety of options in the REFPROP program, including :ref:`saturationtables`, :ref:`isopropertytables`, :ref:`specifiedstatepoints`, :ref:`saturationpointsequilibrium`, and :ref:`saturationpointsbubbledew`. The number of digits displayed, the number format, and the units can be changed by right-clicking on the column header. This will display the :ref:`formatcolumnposition` window. Also accessible from this window is the ability to generate a sequence of numbers, either in steps or exponentially.

The height and width of the rows and columns can be changed by placing the mouse over the line separating two rows or columns, and dragging the line to a new position. The column widths are also enlarged in some operations when the width of the numbers in the column exceeds the column width.

Rows can be deleted by pressing Shift-Del or by using the appropriate menu item (see :ref:`deleterow`). This action permanently removes the row, and a :ref:`Preference <preferences>`  can be set to warn before a row is deleted.

Selecting the contents of the entire table can be done either through :ref:`selectall`  or by clicking the uppermost left cell and dragging the mouse. Clicking the row number or column heading selects the entire row or column. The :ref:`copytabledata` command will copy the text to the clipboard. Text can be pasted into some tables with the :ref:`paste` command.

An averaged value of a selected set of cells can be obtained by clicking the right mouse button once the cells have been selected.
