**Calculate**

The Calculate menu holds commands for initiating the calculations of thermodynamic and transport properties of the :ref:`selected fluid <substance>` . Several modes of calculations are provided with the following commands.

:ref:`Saturation Tables <saturationtables>` 
:ref:`Isoproperty Tables <isopropertytables>` 

:ref:`Specified State Points <specifiedstatepoints>` 
:ref:`Single Point Saturation States <saturationpointsequilibrium>` 
:ref:`Saturation Point (bubble and dew points at same composition) States <saturationpointsbubbledew>` 

Other items associated with calculating properties include:

:ref:`Format, Column Position, and Automatic Data Entry <formatcolumnposition>` 
:ref:`Read File Data <readdata>` 
:ref:`Tables <tables>` 

:ref:`Information on available properties and their definitions <properties>`
