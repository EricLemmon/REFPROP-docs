Isoproperty Tables
******************

Two properties must be specified to fix the state of a fluid. The Isoproperty command allows one of the properties to be held constant while the other is varied in the specified manner. After the two input properties are specified and the OK button is selected, another window appears in which the value of the constant property and the range and increment of the varying property are specified.

After the second OK button is selected, calculations are initiated and a table displaying the results appears. The columns are initially shown in a preselected order and with a default format. The format and position of each column can be changed by right-clicking in the column header to bring up the :ref:`formatcolumnposition`  dialog.

Select the 'Leave active' option to keep this window on top so that multiple isoproperty lines can be generated. Select the 'Add to current table' option to add the calculated values for each new isoproperty to the bottom of the current table.

Multiple tables (from different windows) can be plotted together by selecting all of the desired tables (hold down the Shift or Ctrl key) in the :ref:`newplot`  menu.
