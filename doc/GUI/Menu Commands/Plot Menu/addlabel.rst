Add Label
*********

The add label window allows text to be placed on a plot window or allows text on a current plot to be modified. The plot window where the label will be added must be the active window. The text to be placed on the plot window is entered in the edit field at the top. Other text characteristics may be entered, such as the font type, font size, and style. When the OK button is clicked, the text appears at the center of the plot window. It can then be dragged to any location in the plot by pressing and holding the mouse button down on the text item and then by dragging it to its new location. The coordinates of the label are displayed if the shift key is held down as well.

The degree character can be entered into the text of the label by pressing Alt-248 (or Alt-0176) on the numeric keypad. Alt-253 will add a superscript '2' to the text. Also, Alt-0178 will add a superscript '2' and Alt-0179 will add a superscript '3'. Other special characters of interest using the Alt key include 225: ß, 230 (or 0181): µ, 241 (or 0177): ±, and 246: ÷.

You can change the characteristics of the text item at any time by double clicking on it. This window will reappear and allow you to make the changes. The label can also be deleted. To delete all labels on a plot, double click one of the labels and select the Delete All button. See the :ref:`plotwindow`  description for additional plot window controls.
