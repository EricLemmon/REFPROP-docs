**New Plot**

This command generates a new plot window in which the data in a column of a table can be plotted against data in any other column of the same table. The :ref:`Overlay Plot <overlayplot>`  command plots data within an existing plot window.

By default, it is assumed that data from the active table will be plotted. (The 'active table' is the table that was last accessed and is on top of the other tables.) However, the table from which the data are taken can be selected in the table list at the upper right of the window. It is also assumed that all of the data in the table are to be plotted. If this is not the case, it will be necessary to enter the starting and ending row numbers in the 'From row' and 'To row' fields.

Select the variables to be plotted on the x axis and y axis by clicking on their names in the respective lists. Appropriate minimum, maximum, and interval values are supplied for the selected x and y variables. However, these values may be changed before the plot is generated by modifying the default values, or later with the :ref:`Modify Plot <modifyplot>`  command. Other plot options, such as the scale type, the line type, and the plot symbol, may also be selected in this dialog, or later with the :ref:`Modify Plot <modifyplot>`  command.

The 'Format' option specifies that the numbers on the axis will be printed in either a fixed format or a scientific format, using the number of digits selected in the second box after the 'Format' label.

Data from multiple tables can be plotted simultaneously by selecting multiple items in the 'Plot data from' list and pressing 'OK'. You must be careful that the selected items all contain the same columns. Plotting isoproperty tables and saturation tables together must be done in two steps (once with New Plot, then with Overlay Plot).

Pressing the Save As Default button will add the current settings to the Defaults.Prf file. Subsequent uses of the program will then start with these defaults. The settings can also be saved by choosing :ref:`Save Current Options <savecurrentoptions>` .
