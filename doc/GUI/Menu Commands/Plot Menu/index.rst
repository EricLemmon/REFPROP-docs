The Plot menu provides commands to plot values in any existing table. In addition, many plots, such as temperature-entropy, temperature-enthalpy, and pressure-enthalpy plots can be generated automatically. The commands in this menu are listed below. Click on the command name for more information.

The appearance of the plot window can also be changed by the :ref:`Plot Window <plotwindow>`  controls.
