.. _overlayplot: 

************
Overlay Plot
************

This command works exactly like the :ref:`newplot`  command except that the additional data will be placed in an existing plot window. Overlaid plots use the existing scales for the ordinate and abscissa. However, if the overlaid plot has values that cause part or all of the plot to be off scale, a dialog box is presented that asks if you want to rescale the plot.

See the description of the :ref:`plotwindow`  for information on how to modify the appearance of an existing plot.
