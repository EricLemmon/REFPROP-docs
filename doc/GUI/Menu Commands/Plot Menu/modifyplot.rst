Modify Plot
***********

Many of the attributes of a plot can be changed through the Modify Plot command. This command can be accessed by the pull-down menu item or by double-clicking anywhere within an existing plot. In the former case, the plot in the topmost window is affected. If the topmost window is not a plot, the most recent plot is acted on.

The dialog for this command is similar to that used to specify a new plot, except that the variables plotted cannot be changed (although the x- and y-axis labels can be edited). As with the New Plot command, linear or logarithmic scaling can be selected, and the plot limits and axis label formats can be changed. Options to modify the size of the axis labels are provided below the "X-Axis" and "Y-Axis" portions of the dialog.

A list box in the upper right lists the individual data sets plotted. Selecting an item allows editing of the line and symbol attributes for that data set. The Remove button permanently deletes the selected data set. (Note that for the predefined plots, there is an entry for each of the lines composing these diagrams.) Select the data set for which the line type, symbol, and/or color specifications are to be applied. These changes can be made to one data set at a time or to a multiple selection (by shift-clicking). After changes have been made, either the Apply button or the OK button can be selected. By pressing the Apply button, other changes can be made as well. The changes will not appear on the plot until the OK button has been pressed.

The Highlight button allows you to quickly change the selected line or lines to red with a larger line width. This button immediately exits the Modify Plot command and emphasizes the desired data.

Other options in the Modify Plot menu are described in the :ref:`newplot`  menu.
