Zoom In, Out, Full Frame
************************

There are several ways to zoom in or out of a plot. The easiest way is to click the mouse on the plot and, while holding down the mouse key, drag to a new location. The plot will zoom to the locations where the mouse was pressed and then released. Dragging outside the plot window will increase the plot size to the point where you released the mouse.

You can also zoom in or out by using the commands on the menu bar. If the Zoom Full Frame option is used, the plot will return to either its original size, or the size that was selected from the last use of the :ref:`modifyplot`  command.
